        <h2>Difference Between var, let and const</h2>
        <p>The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let variable is block scope. The scope of a const variable is block scope and on the other hand using var as variable we can update the value from anywhere in the programme while if we use let we can't re-declar the variable but we can re assign the variable. and if we use const we can neither re-assign or re-declear variable</p><br>

        <h2>Difference Between Arrow Function And Regular Function</h2>
        <p>Though Arrow Function is the shorter syntex of regular function but there are few difference between them. arrow function doen't have any this property but regular function has. also arrow function can't be hoisted while regular function can</p><br>


        <h2>Difference Between map, forEach, filter, find</h2>
        <p>Map- We use map to loop through on Array and it returns and output</p><br>
        <p>ForEach- We use forEach to loop through on Array and it doesn't returns anything</p><br>
        <p>Filter- We use filter to loop through on Array and it returns the array of element of an array which matches the condition we applied</p><br>
        <p>Find- We use filter to loop through on Array and it returns the first element of an which matches the condition we applied</p><br>
